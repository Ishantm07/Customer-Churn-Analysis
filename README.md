# **Customer Churn Analysis**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project analyzes customer churn data to identify key factors contributing to customer retention and attrition. Using **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, we explore trends and build visualizations to gain insights into customer behavior.  

## **Dataset**  
- The dataset includes customer details such as **contract type, internet service, payment methods, tenure, and total charges**.  
- The target variable is **Churn (Yes/No)**, indicating whether a customer has left the service.  

## **Key Findings**  
- **Churn Rate**: **26.5%** of customers have churned.  
- **High-Risk Segments**:  
  - Customers with **month-to-month contracts** are more likely to churn.  
  - **Fiber optic internet users** have a higher churn rate.  
  - Customers using **electronic check payments** show more churn behavior.  
- **Tenure Impact**: New customers (0-6 months) churn more frequently, while long-term customers remain stable.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** â€“ Data Cleaning & Processing  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** â€“ Data Visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis  

## **How to Use This Project**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ishantm07/customer-churn-analysis.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Open **Customer Churn.ipynb** in Jupyter Notebook and run the analysis.  

## **Future Scope**  
- Implementing **Machine Learning models** to predict churn probability.  
- Building an **interactive dashboard** for better visualization.  
- Developing **customer retention strategies** based on findings.
